Leafcutter is designed to be a an extremely simple but extensible CMS, with a bare-bones installation providing nothing but flat-file Markdown transformations and some basic theming and image processing tools. The core concept is to build a CMS that starts with as little complexity and attack surface as possible, and break as many additional features as possible out into optional addons.

This repository is the core code, and will not allow you to easily spin up an instance. It is intended to be installed via Composer, and shouldn't be used directly.
